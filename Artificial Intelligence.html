<h1>Many people claim that AI will destroy humanity, while others claim that it will make our lives easier. So, which one should we believe ?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are currently experiencing the fourth industrial revolution. Many new technologies are appearing which can change your life. The Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence, Bitcoin, and so much more. We have to quickly adapt to these technologies, so that we don’t get left behind. The most advanced technology of them all is Artificial Intelligence. AI is one of the most rapidly evolving sectors, with applications ranging from recommendation systems to self-driving cars and chatbots. With all of the benefits, comes a much darker side. Many people claim that AI will destroy humanity, while others claim that it will make our lives easier. So, which one should we believe ?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True AI is decades into the future. What we have now is machine learning. Instead of programming a computer step by step, you can make it learn just like you, trial and error, and lots of practice. You can do this by giving a computer lots of data. It will recognize patterns and make predictions based on it. Let's say you are making a program to recognize the difference between a bike and a car. You will give it multiple pictures of cars and bikes. It will realize a pattern between all the cars and bikes. When you give it a picture of a car, it will use the pattern it found and made a decision. Machine learning is only as good as the data you give to it, so you have to use lots of high quality data. If the data is only collected for something specific, the AI will only work for it. To make a learning machine, earlier scientists looked for clues to find out what is the best at learning. Nothing is better than a human brain at this. The human brain contains cells called neurons which help it recognize patterns. It's nothing complex. Multiple inputs get taken into the neuron and get processed into a new signal going out. The true capabilities of this are unleashed when systems use multiple neurons and layers. However, there is a difference between AI and neural networks. AI refers to machines that are able to mimic human cognitive skills, while neural networks are a network of artificial neurons, whose functionality is loosely based on animal neurons.
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people claim that just like how Homo Sapiens dominate all animals, AI will dominate us. AI and machine learning have the capability to keep on learning, so it can eventually surpass our knowledge. It's also much more efficiant than us at doing tasks, since it's much faster, and rarely makes mistakes. Hollywood movies have already put an image in many people's minds that AI will become self-aware, and kill every human. Before, it used to be science fiction, but it's now becoming a reality. People are asking for more research on the dangers of AI. After you get to know about all of them, it will be hard to look at AI as a technology which will make our lives easier. As AI gets smarter, it will become more efficient than humans at certain jobs. Since you don't need to pay it to do a job, companies will start automating all  of their jobs. It will become very hard to get a job, and this will lead to very high unemployment rates. This has become a trend, since every time a new technology is created, jobs are killed. AI will have a much bigger impact, since it can impact every sector. Also, for the first time, creative jobs like a graphic designer are in danger. For many years, people have always thought that when a new technology appears, all the boring, repetitive jobs will be taken. Even though AI will take millions of jobs, millions of more will come with it. The graphic designer’s job will disappear, but a new job will replace it. AI won’t take your job, but a person who knows how to use AI will. Currently, most  company's inside operations. This creates the risk of the employee's company's sensitive information being leaked. To tackle this problem, companies like Samsung are building their own AI, which they can trust.
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many companies are locked into battle with each other to decide who will win the race for AI. A small company which many people haven’t heard of, OpenAI, has been winning this race. Their latest product, ChatGPT, is a huge hit. It received staggering growth recently, hitting 1 million users in just 5 days. No other company has been able to achieve this, including tech giants like Facebook. OpenAI wasn’t the first to create an AI robot. Microsoft, Facebook, and many other companies have attempted this and failed many times. Their robots learned inappropriate language and started hating people. ChatGPT has been successful in preventing this. A new version of ChatGPT, GPT 5, is soon to be launched. It will be used in hospitals to treat patients. GPT 4, has already saved many animal and human lives which doctors couldn't. One man's dog had been infected with a disease, but the vet couldn't figure it out. He gave GPT-4 all the symptoms his dog was experiencing, and it predicted the disease. It turned out to be correct. Because of this, the dog's life was saved. ChatGPT has forced competitors like Google and Microsoft to launch their own chatbots. Even though Microsoft and OpenAI have a partnership, Microsoft still launched its own chatbot, Bing AI. Google’s chatbot, Bard, is flopping. People just seem to hate it. Whenever Bard makes an error, everyone laughs at it, but when ChatGPT makes an error, it’s just a meme. Overtime, this opinion may change.
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like how you need to know how to use a computer to get a good job today, you will need to know how to use Artificial Intelligence to get one in the future. The same is to say with companies. Companies which don’t adapt to Artificial Intelligence will flop. There are already many examples of conglomerates which didn’t adapt to new technologies and got crushed by competition. Blockbuster lost to Netflix, because it didn’t respond to the birth of the internet and devices. AI companies will mainly have to focus on profit instead of market share during their initial stages. When the first internet companies were born, most of them did not care about profit. Still, they were worth billions because investors were pouring so much money into them. This created a huge bubble, but when investors realized they weren't getting their returns back, since the companies weren't profitable, they stopped. The bubble bursted, which caused every internet company's stock price to drop. The smaller companies went bankrupt, since they weren't gaining any money. The same thing might happen to AI companies, so to prevent that, they will have to make sure that they are profitable.
<br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI is a fascinating and complex technology which can perform tasks that require human intelligence. AI poses many benefits and challenges to us, as it can improve our lives, and solve our problems, but also creates many problems to tackle. It is not only an opportunity or a threat, but also a responsibility that requires our awareness.</p>
