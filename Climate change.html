            <p>One day, I was supposed to make a presentation about natural disasters. When I was searching up details for it, 
                the web led me to climate change images and its effect on our planet that shook me up. 
                Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time and it is essential that we take action now to reduce its effects.
                I considered ways to raise awareness of it among my friends so that they, too, might contribute to society's efforts to mitigate its impacts.    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                
                &nbsp The most simple thing we can do is reduce the usage of energy for e.g. electricity and gas. The more electricity and gas we use , 
                the more greenhouse gases are emitted,which lead to global warming.There are small small things we can do to conserve energy for e.g. turn off the 
                lights when we leave the room, use renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, use energy-efficient appliances,walk instead of using car 
                where possible, or go for running instead of using gym.    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                According to a report, Canadians are among the world's worst carbon emitters. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes climate change. One possible 
                way to control this could be a lifestyle change.  By keeping the “temperature need” low and opting to dress warmly, we should attempt to reduce the 
                amount of time that furnaces are used.  In summer, we should also limit using AC and instead use fans and open windows for ventilation. If everyone 
                in the world follows this, it would make a huge difference.    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                Many people these days tell us to recycle, but in my opinion reuse is always a better option if possible. When we recycle, the items go to the 
                factories which process them. Those factories are also a major source of carbon emission. Reusing items such as clothing, furniture, electronics, 
                containers can help to reduce the amount of energy and resources needed to produce new items. Additionally, reusing items can help to reduce the 
                amount of waste that is sent to landfills, which can help to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are released into the atmosphere.    &nbsp

                We need to spread awareness so that more people can see the negative effects of climate change and begin to make little but significant efforts to 
                stop it. Many people unknowingly emit greenhouse gases and raising awareness can reduce that. Children are the world's future, and if they are aware 
                of the implications of climate change, they may take many positive steps . We can hang anti-climate change posters  in school, neighbourhoods. Trees 
                absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen, which helps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We can have 
                social events to plant trees.    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

                In conclusion, climate change is a serious global issue that requires immediate and sustained action from all of us.  By taking action now, we can 
                ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy a healthy and prosperous planet. Together we can and we will make an impact.    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
