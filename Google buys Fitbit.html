<h2> Acquisition by Google - a boon or a curse for Fitbit</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2021, Fitbit was bought by Google. Google was trying to increase its presence with health and wellness watches. Many people now think that Google is destroying Fitbit. They claim that because of Google many new bugs are popping up in Fitbit watches. Because of these bugs many consumers have replaced their Fitbit watch or have stopped using many functions. However, there are others who believe that with Google, Fitbit will make their products cheaper, more usable, and better.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the table below, I have compared the positives and negatives of this acquisition:

<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=Black>
<colgroup>
    <col span="2" style="background-color:light blue" >
    <col style="background-color:black">
  </colgroup>
 
   <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fitbit’s technology and Google’s AI can make a much better watch</td>
    <td>Latest software updates had many bugs</td>
 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because of this acquisition, both Google and Apple have smartwatches. This has led to more competition which is good for consumers</td>
    <td>On earlier occasions, Google has destroying other companies due to their inability to integrate them into Google’s culture</td>
  </tr>
 
  <tr>
  <td>This acquisition will boost Google's presence in the health/wellness wearables market which can lead to more innovation</td>  
     <td>Google is not good at making hardware</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Fitbit’s integration with other Google products has become better</td>
     <td>Many people don’t want to buy Google’s products because they believe they have many bugs. This will affect Fitbit in future</td>
  </tr>


</table>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In my view, Fitbit and Google have a bright future together. Google’s software and Fitbit’s technology can make a cheaper, more usable, and better watch. Many advanced and new features in Fitbit have been added after its acquisition by Google. Ability to measure SPO2 is one such example. I am hopeful that most of the bugs will eventually disappear. Even though Google has a reputation of buying and destroying companies, its Fitbit acquisition has the potential of being successful.
