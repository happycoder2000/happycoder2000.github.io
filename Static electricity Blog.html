<h1>All about Static Electricity</h1>


&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It can strike at you at any time. You may be walking across a carpet and reaching for your spoon when, ZAP ! When you get shocked by a doorknob, or when your hair stands when you rub it on a balloon, it is the result of static electricity. To understand what static electricity is, you first have to know what an atom is.

<br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Atoms are made up of tiny particles called protons, neutrons and electrons. Protons have a positive charge, while neutrons have a neutral charge. Protons and neutrons are bound together in an atom's nucleus as a result of the strong nuclear force. Electrons are negatively charged, and orbit the nucleus of an atom. They are very tiny and almost insignificant in mass, being 2000 times smaller than protons and neutrons. Electrons and protons get pulled towards each other because they have opposite charges. Magnets are made with the help of this.

<br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Static electricity occurs when two or more bodies come into contact and separate again. It results in the transfer of electrons from one atom to another. In an atom, the number of protons and electrons balance out, which is why most matter you come across is electrically neutral. Sometimes, electrons, being so tiny, move between different surfaces. This leads to one of the objects having a positive charge, and the other having a negative charge, but mother nature tends towards balance. When the object with a positive charge touches another object, the electrons from the other object hop onto the object with a positive charge. This results in having a shock-like sensation.

<br><br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are 4 ways you can cause static discharge. The most common way is to cause friction. Let’s say you have a metal rod that is electrically neutral, and you rub it on a towel. The physical interaction will cause the metal rod’s electron’s to hop onto a towel, leaving the metal rod with an overall positive charge, and the towel with a negative charge. Sometimes, you  can create static discharge within an object. Place a positively charged rod beside a neutrally charged rod. The proton’s on the positively charged rod will pull on the electron’s in the neutrally charged  rod. The side with more electrons is negatively charged, while the side with more protons is positively charged. If we now bring a positively charged rod in contact with a neutral rod, since opposites attract, the electrons from the 2nd rod will keep on moving to the first rod until both the rod’s charges are positive. This is charging by contact.

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Static electricity in your house may be a minor nuisance, but outdoors, it’s a destructive force of nature, known as lightning.	Due to the circulation of water droplets and ice,the electrons separate from the protons. The electrons go to the bottom of the cloud, while protons go to the top of the cloud. Since opposite charges attract, the electrons in the cloud leap towards the protons on the
ground. This creates the fork shaped spark you see.

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Static electricity is a very important concept in science. It is used in many things, and affects our everyday lives. Still, many people don’t know about it. We should all learn this important scientific principle
