            <h2 id="title">A trip to the past</h2>
                
            <p id="essay">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, there lived a sharp-witted boy named Max. He had light-blue glass, and short, blonde hair. Max hated going on trips, because he knew something was bound to go wrong. A few weeks ago, he had to go on a field trip to the museum. All of his classmates were very excited, unlike him. Max thought the museum was unengaging, but he had no choice. The next day, it was raining heavily. Max hoped for the trip to be canceled, but it wasn’t. During the drive, the mapping system malfunctioned. They were all lost. Suddenly, an asteroid hit them.
    <br> <br>
                
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Max woke up, he found himself in a very strange place. It was very sunny and hot. There was a lot of farmland. Max could see farmers getting beaten and forced to work. There were very poor people on the streets. Everyone except him was wearing dusty clothes with holes. Max was horrified. In the distance, he heard a group of people marching. Max assumed it was an army, so he ran into a nearby empty house. Max was correct. They burnt the city down, and took everything they found, including people. Max didn’t know what to do, and his mind was racing. The soldiers burst into the house Max was hiding in. A tall, bearded man found him. He grabbed Max by the neck and started pulling him. Max fought back, but the man punched him in the face, which made him unconscious.     <br> <br>

               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The capturers kept Max in a big mansion as a servant. He was treated horribly, and was sometimes hit. At night, he was told to sleep in a cell. During midnight, the same day, an old man got Max out of the mansion. The old man gave him a gold, trophy cup and told him,
“I have supernatural powers which let me see what others can't. It appears to me that you are from the future.”. He added, “This cup will take you back to your time if you fill it with water from the nearby lake”. He suddenly vanished into thin air. Max realized that he had traveled to the 8th century. An attack similar to the one he experienced happened at this time. Max did not know where the nearby lake was. He took a look in the cup and found a paper note. It was a map to the lake. He followed the map, which led him to a forest. It had many tall and lush trees. There were numerous thriving species. Max soon reached the lake. He filled the whole cup with water. Suddenly, a wormhole appeared. It pulled him into it. Max was soon back at his school.

 <br> <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Max walked back home. When his parents asked him how the field trip went, he said that everything went fine. Max was terrified after his journey, and is happy to be back home.     </p>
